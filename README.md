Digital Signature Verifier
This is a simple Python desktop application that demonstrates how digital signatures work using RSA cryptography. It allows users to generate key pairs, sign messages with a private key, and verify the signature with a public key.

What it Does
Generate RSA Keys: Create a new 2048-bit RSA public/private key pair.

Sign Documents: Create a unique digital signature for any text message using your private key.

Verify Signatures: Check if a message is authentic and has not been altered by verifying its signature with the sender's public key. This is the core of proving authenticity and integrity.
